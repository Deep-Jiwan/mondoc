### Setup & Build Steps

Below is a shell script outlining the steps to build the dashboard (frontend) and backend assets. You can save the following script as `setup.sh` (remember to make it executable with `chmod +x setup.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit immediately if a command fails

# Build the dashboard (React app)
echo "Building dashboard..."
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run build

# Copy the built frontend to the backend's public folder
echo "Copying dashboard build to backend..."
rm -rf ../backend/public
mkdir -p ../backend/public
cp -r dist/* ../backend/public/

# Setup the backend
echo "Setting up backend..."
cd ../backend
npm install

# Start the backend server
echo "Starting backend server..."
node server.js
